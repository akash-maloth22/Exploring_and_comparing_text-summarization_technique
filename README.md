# Exploring and Comparing Text Summarization Techniques

A comprehensive and modular pipeline that explores multiple text summarization techniques using both extractive and abstractive methods. This project includes data cleaning, sentence scoring, named entity recognition, and transformer-based summarization, allowing a detailed comparison of summarization strategies.

## 📌 Features

- Text pre-processing and normalization
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spaCy
- Extractive summarization using frequency and TF-IDF methods
- Abstractive summarization with transformer models (e.g., BART, T5)
- Evaluation with ROUGE scores and readability metrics
- Visual comparison of techniques

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NLTK
- spaCy
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- Sumy
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

📊 Pipeline Overview
Input Preparation: Load and clean raw text or dataset

Preprocessing: Tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal

NER: Extract important named entities from text

Summarization:

Extractive: Frequency-based, TF-IDF, or LSA (Sumy)

Abstractive: Using transformer models like BART, T5

Evaluation: Compare summaries using ROUGE scores and readability metrics
